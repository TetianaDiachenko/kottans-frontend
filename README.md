Here I will collect the results of passing the [Frontend course](https://kottans.org/frontend/faq.html) from [Kottans](https://kottans.org/).

## Git Basics

I studied the materials of the course [Introduction to Git and GitHub](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-git-github) on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/).


Before I used some basic Git's commands and know how to work with it locally and remotes, but on this course, I discovered some new topics:

 	* prehistory of creating VCS 
 	* detailed information about the basic Git workflow 
 	(when in each repository we have a Git directory, a working tree, and a staging area) 
	* pull requests. 

Then I had some practice in the [learngitbranching.js.org](learngitbranching.js.org) (basis and Push & Pull - remote repositories in Git!). These tasks were very usefull to understanding how the git works.

So in the future I'll be used Git in my projects.
