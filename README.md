#Git Basics

<p> I studied the materials of the course Introduction to Git and GitHub on Coursera.</p> 
<p> Before I used some basic Git's comands and know how to work with it locally and remotes, but on this course, I discovered some new topics:
 		<ul>
 		<li> prehistory of creating VCS </li>
 		<li> detailed information about the basic Git workflow (when in each repository we have a Git directory, a working tree, and a staging area) </li>
 		<li> * pull requests. </li>
<p> Then I had some practice in the learngitbranching.js.org (basis and Push & Pull - remote repositories in Git!). These tasks were very usefull to understanding how the git works.</p>
<p> So in the future I'll be used git in my projects.</p>
