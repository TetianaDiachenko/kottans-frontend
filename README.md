Here I will collect the results of passing the [Frontend course](https://kottans.org/frontend/faq.html) from [Kottans](https://kottans.org/):

## Git Basics and Git Collaboration

I studied the materials of the course [Introduction to Git and GitHub](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-git-github) on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/):

Before I used some basic Git commands and know how to work with it locally and remotely, but on this course, I discovered some new topics:

* prehistory of creating VCS 
* detailed information about the basic Git workflow (when in each repository we have a Git directory, a working tree, and a staging area) 	
* pull-merge-push workflow
* pull requests
* tracking(bugs) issues
* a continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD)

Then I had some practice in the [learngitbranching.js.org](https://learngitbranching.js.org). These tasks were very useful to understanding how the git works.

So in the future I'll be used Git in my projects.

## Linux CLI, and HTTP

I studied course [Linux Survival](https://linuxsurvival.com). I was very glad, that the linux commands from the first module I used before. So it was enough ease. The next modules had new information for me. And I hope, it'll be useful for my work in the future.

</details>

I read these articles:

[HTTP: Протокол, який повинен розуміти кожний веб-розробник - Частина 1](https://code.tutsplus.com/uk/tutorials/http-the-protocol-every-web-developer-must-know-part-1--net-31177) ([the original English article](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/http-the-protocol-every-web-developer-must-know-part-1--net-31177?ec_unit=translation-info-language))

[HTTP: Протокол, який повинен розуміти кожний веб-розробник - Частина 2](https://code.tutsplus.com/uk/tutorials/http-the-protocol-every-web-developer-must-know-part-2--net-31155) ([the original English article](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/http-the-protocol-every-web-developer-must-know-part-2--net-31155?ec_unit=translation-info-language))


The new information was about:

* some HTTP Request Verbs (trace, options)
* HTTP Headers 
* TLS or SSL (Transport Layer Security or Secure Sockets Layer) in HTTPS
* HTTP Authentication
* HTTP Caching

This was very important information. At a minimum, I will definitely use HTTP requests in my future work. And I hope the rest of the information will be useful for me as well.

## Intro to HTML and CSS

I studied the materials of the course [Intro to HTML & CSS](https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-css-javascript-for-web-developers) (1,2 weeks) on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/):

</details>

I used HTML, CSS before in my work, that's why almost everything was common for me. But there are couple new sings, that I got to know:

* HTML 5 appeared as a result of joint work of W3C and WHATWG.
* useful sources about [The W3C HTML5 standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110405/) and [Browser Statistics](https://www.w3schools.com/browsers/)

I practiced [HTML](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html) & [CSS](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css) in [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn). It was nice to remember the first time I did it. Codecademy was the first source where I tried how HTML and CSS work. It was like a magic for me. Since then, I decided to learn more about these and other Frontend development technologies.

## Responsive Web Design

I read an article [Responsive web design basics](https://web.dev/i18n/en/responsive-web-design-basics/). I have some basic knowledge about responsive web design. Nevertheless, there was new information for me:

* Multiple-column Layout (Multicol), which uses column-width property for creating responsive numbers of columns. 

* Optimization text for reading (70 to 80 characters per line = about 8 to 10 words in English for mobil and 550px for larger screens)

I watched videos about [FLEXBOX](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLM6XATa8CAG5mPV60dMmjMRrHVW4LmV2x). I used flexbox before and I like this technology. From these lessons, I discovered some detailed information about the flex property, which consists of flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis (for ex., flex: 0, 1, auto;). I didn't use it before, but I want to do it in my future projects.

And I watched videos about [Grid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV92IdMGFfA&list=PLM6XATa8CAG5pXQrW_kDaeZb_uIAMNZIm). I only once used this technology. So it was useful for me to mention all the possibilities of the grid.

I had a practice with flexbox and git commands playing in cool games [Flexbox Froggy](http://flexboxfroggy.com/#uk) and [Grid Garden](http://cssgridgarden.com/). Of course, I'll be use these technologies in my future projects.

## HTML & CSS Practice

I made popup by using only HTML and CSS. It was new experience using checkbox for buttons, which open or close content. 

It's my result:

## JS Basics

I listened the [Introduction to Javascript](https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-css-javascript-for-web-developers/home/week/4) on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/). It was helpful, but this course was created in 2015 and there were many changes from that year that were compiled into ES6. 

But the practice on [Freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/) gave a basic idea of modern Javascript.
