Git Basics

I studied the materials of the course Introduction to Git and GitHub on Coursera.
Before I used some basic Git's comands and know how to work with it locally and remotes, but on this cousre, I discovered some new topics:
 		* prehistory of creating VCS
 		* detailed information about the basic Git workflow (when in each repository we have a Git directory, a working tree, and a staging area) 
 		* pull requests.
Then I had some practice in the learngitbranching.js.org (basis and Push & Pull - remote repositories in Git!). These tasks were very usefull to understanding how the git works.
